      <p class="shortcomment cmt">This is the experimental package of mux.lease.</p><div class="fullcomment"><div class="comment cmt"><p>This is the experimental package of mux.lease.  Right now, this is all
experimental code around leasing, especially leasing around garbage
collections.  We haven't hammered out exactly what the api will be, so it's
in large part private and is subject to change.</p><p>If you want to experiment with GC avoidance, you need to turn on the flag
<code>com.twitter.finagle.mux.lease.exp.drainerEnabled</code> to enable GC avoidance,
and right now it only works with parallel old and CMS.  So far, we've seen
promising results with GC avoidance locally, but haven't had the opportunity
to run scientific load tests when simulating production load.</p><p>It can be useful to turn on the
<code>com.twitter.finagle.mux.lease.exp.drainerDebug</code> flag to get much more
granular data about what is going on.  Turning on this flag will log stats
for each garbage collection avoidance attempt.  Especially interesting is to
see how long it takes for a server to drain, how many outstanding requests
there still are, and whether any GCs were natural instead of triggered.  If
there are still outstanding requests when the GC is triggered, it might make
sense to turn on nacking, or allow more time for draining.</p><p>You can turn on nacking for a server after the lease has expired by turning
on the flag <code>com.twitter.finagle.mux.lease.exp.nackOnExpiredLease</code>.  The way
this behaves is that it nacks all requests which come in after a 0 lease has
been issued. This has two effects--it corrects behavior for clients which are
slow to respect leases and turns on failure accrual for clients which
continue to send requests.  One possible area of future work would be
allowing consumers to configure whether or not Finagle's failure accrual
mechanism considers these nacks to be failures.  Another possible improvement
would be to nack requests which are already partially completed, instead of
just new incoming requets.</p><p>The <code>com.twitter.finagle.mux.lease.exp.drainerDiscountRange</code> flag modulates
how the server chooses the discount, which is when it expires the lease.  The
left is the absolute lower bound on the range from which it will select
randomly.  The right is the absolute upper bound on the range from which it
will select randomly.  It chooses a uniform random number of bytes from
between the upper bound and the max of the percentile number of bytes
generated in a single request and the lower bound.  The absolute lower bound
does double duty--it is also used for choosing when to stop waiting for
stragglers and run a GC regardless.</p><p>The <code>com.twitter.finagle.mux.lease.exp.drainerPercentile</code> flag specifies the
percentile of the incoming request distribution that will be chosen for
deciding how long it takes to handle a single request.</p><p>If you're not working with a JDK which supports System.minorGc, GCA will not
work properly, since it will not just run a minor GC when you trigger
System.gc.  Although the behavior will continue to be correct, it will be
less efficient.  Assuming you're draining properly, your pause times won't
affect your latency, but you will have lower throughput, since your server
will spend more time not receiving traffice.  One possible direction for
further work is to allocate big arrays until you trigger a minor GC, but this
must be done slightly delicately to avoid triggering a major collection.</p><p>The drainerDiscountRange is of insufficient fidelity.  The biggest problem is
that it doesn't make sense to conflate the hard cutoff for triggering a GC
with the drainerDiscountRange minimum, so it should probably be separated
out.</p><p>Observing leases on the client side can be made slightly smarter too.  It
might make sense to have some kind of communication which encourages clients
to stop sending requests that it guesses will soon fail (for leases that will
soon expire).</p><p>NB: large parts of this package might suddenly end up in util-jvm
